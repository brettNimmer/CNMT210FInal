                    Hi, my name is Brett Nimmer and I've been lifting a few years now; the purpose of this 
                    website is to educate those new to lifting. There are countless resources online that acheive this purpose.
                    Think of this website more as a pamphlet, it's not going to give you everything you will ever need in regards to supplements
                    and the gym. However the hope is to open your eyes to taking supplements through
                    educating you on the advatanges, drawbacks, and overall purpose. As a lifter myself
                    I have only been experimenting with supplements for about two years now. That being
                    said I've talked to many indviduals with far more experince in these fields than myself.
                    Despite this, I do encourage any indviduals reading this website to further explore online,
                    do your own research as to feel confident and comfortable with what you put in your body.
